# Another CV Maker  
### *Because the world definitely needed CV Maker #12,483.*

Welcome to my CV builder — a project so original it joins the **thousands** of identical ones scattered across the internet like digital tumbleweeds.

Yes, it’s **neo-brutalist**.  
Yes, it has **AI**.  
Yes, it was **vibe-coded** at questionable hours.  
And no, this does not make it special.

---

## What Is This?
It’s a CV/Resume builder.  
You already know what it does — **because you've seen 200 others doing the exact same thing.**

Features include:
- A neo-brutalist UI that screams “Look, I know design trends too!”
- AI integration, because not adding AI in 2025 is considered a crime
- Layouts carefully crafted to pretend I didn’t copy my past job descriptions into ChatGPT

---

## Why Does This Exist?
Let’s be brutally honest:

- I wanted an excuse to play with a neo-brutalist palette  
- I wanted to feel productive without actually solving a real problem  
- And deep down, I knew:  
  **no one asked for this, but that has never stopped anyone from shipping projects before**

If you think this project fills a unique gap in the market…  
It doesn’t.  
But it does fill a gap in my *portfolio*, and that’s what really matters.

## AI Features
Because every modern project needs a little AI duct tape:

- “Smart” summaries that make your job sound 10x more important than it was  
- Bullet point enhancements that turn “I filed documents” into  
  **“I optimized operational workflows across cross-functional teams”**  
- Rewrite modes: *Professional*, *Concise*, *Punchy*, and *Delusional Confidence™*  
- AI that will confidently generate text you’ll probably rewrite anyway

---

## Tech Stack
- **React**, because what else would it be  
- **Tailwind**, because writing CSS manually would require self-respect  
- **AI** (Gemini — not because I'm loyal, but because it's the only key I own and it's so absurdly easy to use that my skill issue barely shows)

---

## Status
Being actively developed.  
Prepare for:
- Bugs  
- Questionable decisions  
- Features added purely for vibes  
- UI choices that imply I discovered neo-brutalism on Twitter yesterday

---

## License
MIT.  
Because letting other people copy this masterpiece of mediocrity feels weirdly poetic.

---

## Support
If this project made you laugh, exhale through your nose, or question my life choices,  
**drop a star**.  
It won’t make the project more useful, but it *will* validate my unhealthy need for external approval.

## Run Locally  

Because what’s a modern web project without a section explaining how to run **npm install**?

**Prerequisites:**  
- Node.js (shocking, I know)

### 1. Install dependencies  
You guessed it:  
```npm install```
### 2. Set your GEMINI_API_KEY
Put your Gemini API key in ```.env.local``` because apparently everything needs an API key now — even your CV builder.

```GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here```
### 3. Run the app
Finally, launch the masterpiece:

`npm run dev`
## Fun fact: 
**This entire README was generated by AI, completing the beautiful, pointless circle of using AI to describe an AI-infused project no one asked for.**
